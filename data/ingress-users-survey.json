    "How many Ingress objects per cluster?",
    "How many paths in the Ingress definition? (Across all `hosts` sections.)",
    "How many different Services referenced by a single Ingress?",
    "Do you have different Ingresses pointing to the same service?",
    "If yes, what is your use case?",
    "Do you have different paths within an Ingress pointing to the same service?",
    "If yes, what is your use case?",
    "How many annotations in your Ingress object? (Not including status annotations populated by the controller).",
    "What are your annotations used for? (Check all that apply.)",
    "Do you expect the Ingress spec (without annotations) to be transparently portable across environments?",
    "Would you prefer a less portable spec that is more expressive or a less expressive but more portable spec?",
    "Have you migrated an Ingress configuration between providers?",
    "Is the vanilla Ingress (no annotations) expressive enough for your application?",
    "If you could add one feature/change one thing about the current Ingress specification, what would that be?"

At that point the Ingress resource was basically empty. Its only purpose was now to identity services (not even paths) so that endpoint arrays can be passed to the nginx template Go variables.\n\nIn the end I ask myself wether the Ingress spec can even succeed in the face of all the differences between ingress controller options. Perhaps the custom resource approach used on Voyager is the right model after all.\n\nPortability accross clouds can be achieved by simply running the ingress controller inside the cluster -- the cloud-specific portion that remains is a Service[type=LoadBalancer], and that seems reasonable."

Ideally the design would enforce that the ingress provider (nginx etc) would reside on on or more nodes (ideally separate due to cpu or security concerns but i digress) and would expose a node port that would be mapped to a dns provider. This removes most all of the complexities around aws vs gce and has the bonus of working onprem just as well."
